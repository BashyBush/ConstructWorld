Mario Related bugs
- Big & Fire Mario can clip through invisible slopes if running.
- Running then letting go of either left or right while holding run will cause Mario to still be in the running animation and freezes on a frame until he fully stops moving.

Others 
- World Map while somewhat finished. Most parts are unfinished.
- Some objects won't pause their animations when pausing.
- Shells are known to randomly rotate if interacting with another shell
- Shells are still not done btw.
