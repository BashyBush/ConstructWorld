# Construct World
An _attempt_ to port some of Super Mario World into Construct 3
![](/github/images/constructworldgameplay.gif)
## What is this exactly?
This is pretty much a project where I attempted to port some or most of Mario World into Construct 3.
Why? Simple. I was pretty much bored and nothing else.

Some stuff from SMW like most of Mario Movement, Blocks, Some enemies, (tbh probably like one lmao) etc..
During the making of this. I had one goal in mind. Try to make things as accurate as possible. Not quite everything will be fully accurate but things like Mario himself controls mostly like how he does in SMW. (hopefully lol.)

However some things like a few enemies, Fire Mario, The World map and some other objects I might've forgotten is completely unfinished. Expect problems with these. (also expect sprites that I haven't removed that aint from SMW but from me as placeholders lol)

## Why release it now in a unfinished state?
To be quite honest. I'm not sure if i'll keep working on this project since I been busy with other things and plus most of this project was made while I had a access code to use all of Construct 3's features and that soon enough I might not have access to it anymore. (unless I buy a subscription for one)

That why i'm releasing the project in the current state it is. I might continue working on this but that hugely depends on if I have the time to work on this and if I also still have access to Construct 3's features.

## Requirements.
- Either a Active Construct 3 Subscription or through a Access Code to unlock all Construct 3's Features.
   - The free version will **NOT** work due to the project using way over the event limit.
- [Tiled Sprite Plugin](https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/addons/1185/tiled-sprite) (this _should_ come included with this project but if it doesn't download the plugin here)

## Quick QNA Section (incase)
- Will you still continue with this project even after this release?
   - Depends if I have the time to continue working on this and to also fix the current problems with this project.
- Can I try out this without compiling?
   - Sure! Check the releases to download the current public build.
- Can I use this for a fan-game?
   - Sure I guess. There will be some things that are left unfinished at the moment (like fire mario for example) but if you want to still use this eitherway then sure! Just aleast credit me if you do plan on using this engine.
- Does this include things like Cape Mario or Yoshi?
   - No. I'm not sure if i'll even be able to add those two into the engine if I do continue updating this. 
- Wait. Why are there objects that didn't even came from SMW?
   - When I started this project. I used a pre-existing project of my own that had some things already added like the pause menu, a Timer and a different Test level. Some of these I reused here but some didn't however I never bothered to remove these during the making of this project just incase one day I needed them. Be aware that these old things are probably even more broken.
- I found a bug! Can I still report it for a fix?
   - If I have the free time. I'll probably check what it is and see if I can fix it... I'm not quite sure if i'll keep rebuilding a playable build for these fixes but they should appear on the current source code in this git.
- I made a Pull Request for a bug fix or a improvement for something. Will you add it into the engine?
   - To be quite honest it depends. I'm quite new to GitHub (at the time at writing this) so maybe it depends I guess..?
