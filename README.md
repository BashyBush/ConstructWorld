# Construct World
An _attempt_ to port some of Super Mario World into Construct 3

## What is this exactly?

This is pretty much a project where I attempted to port some or most of Mario World into Construct 3.
Why? Simple. I was pretty much bored and nothing else.

Some stuff from SMW like most of Mario Movement, Blocks, Some enemies, (tbh probably like one lmao) etc..
During the making of this. I had one goal in mind. Try to make things as accurate as possible. Not quite everything will be fully accurate but things like Mario himself controls mostly like how he does in SMW. (hopefully lol.)

# Requirements.
- Either a Active Construct 3 Subscription or a Access Code. The free version will not work due to the project using way over the event limit.
-
