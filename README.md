# Construct World
An _attempt_ to port some of Super Mario World into Construct 3

## What is this exactly?

This is pretty much a project where I attempted to port some or most of Mario World into Construct 3.
Why? Simple. I was pretty much bored and nothing else.

Some stuff from SMW like most of Mario Movement, Blocks, Some enemies, (tbh probably like one lmao) etc..
During the making of this. I had one goal in mind. Try to make things as accurate as possible. Not quite everything will be fully accurate but things like Mario himself controls mostly like how he does in SMW. (hopefully lol.)

However some things like a few enemies, Fire Mario, The World map and some other objects I might've forgotten is completely unfinished. Expect problems with these. (also expect sprites that I haven't removed that aint from SMW but from me as placeholders lol)

## Requirements.
- Either a Active Construct 3 Subscription or a Access Code.
   - The free version will **NOT** work due to the project using way over the event limit.
- [Tiled Sprite Plugin](https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/addons/1185/tiled-sprite) (this _should_ come included with this project but if it doesn't download the plugin here)

## Quick QNA Section
- Will you still continue with this project?
   - Depends if I have the time to continue working on this and to also fix the current problems with this project.
- Can I use this for a fan-game?
   - Sure. There will be some things that are left unfinished at the moment (like fire mario for example) but if you want to still use this eitherway then sure! Just aleast credit me if you do plan on using this aleast.
- Does this include things like Cape Mario or Yoshi?
   - No. I'm not sure if i'll even be able to add those two into the engine if I do continue updating this.
